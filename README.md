Hi ðŸ‘‹! My name is Ignacio and I'm a 20 year old Full stack web developer from Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·.

I was always very passionate about technology and the IT sector so in 2022 I decided to join the bootcamp from Henry, where I learned from scratch to build web pages, both from the front end and the back end. There, I also worked in two projects, one by myself, in which I settled the things I learned before, and the other one in groups, where I learned how to work with other people in an efficient way, and also practiced Scrum methodology.

I believe that my main soft skills are active listening, critical thinking, multitasking and problem solving.

Currently I'm looking for a front end remote position.

My stack of technologies includes:
-Git
Front-End:
-React
-Redux
-Bootstrap
-CSS
-Typescript

Back-End:
-Express
-Node.js
-Sequelize
-PostgreSQL
-Typescript
-Auth0
